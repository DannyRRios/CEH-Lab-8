This is a screenshot of the final step I completed! 

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab we performed various ways of sniffing for attack and defense points. We first performed a variety of attacks like MAC flooding, DHCP starvation, ARP poising and spoofed MAC addresses. We then performed sniffing using Wireshark, OmniPeek network analyzer, SteelCentral Packet analyzer to view sensitive information that can be viewed in the network. Lastly we used various tools to be able to detect an instance of ARP poisoning.
